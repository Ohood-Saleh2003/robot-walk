### Steps to control servo motors for robot walking movement :

1. Determine the servo motors: The required number of servo motors for walking movement starts, then what is required is 6 motors, where 2 are allocated for each leg.

2. Plan the walking plan for movement: Develop a movement strategy, including the correct sequence for each movement in (such as lifting, positioning, and landing on the ground) and make sure to stay.

3. Assign servo motors: Assign each servo motor to a specific point in or foot, so that radical actions can be taken for it.

4. Programming engineer: Program each servo motor to move or foot to the required angle at the appropriate time, according to the plan that you successfully complete.

5. Movement coordination: Works on the movement of servo motors and synchronizes the movement smoothly and balanced.

6. Movement testing: Test the movement of movements and implementation of any necessary new developments in servo and timing to improve performance.
